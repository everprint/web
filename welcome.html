			<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
			<p>We have a great pleasure to introduce and recommend our Pre-inked Stamp making machine to add into your line of business. Our Machine makes the rubber in seconds and to be completed the stamp for delivery within FIVE to TEN minutes to customer. It cuts down the manufacturing time in order to provide the excellent services to your customers.
			</p>

			<p>Please review the cost of materials and time spending analysis in the separate sheets for your consideration. The comparison of the manufacturing procedures between our Pre-inked stamp and Self-inking stamp will give you some ideas to determine should you out sourcing your stamp making business or make your own manufacturing within your Shop/Company with a small additional investment. With our Pre-inked Stamp making Machine in your Shop/Company, you are able to control and commit the delivery time to your customers. Your customers come to your Shop/Company once time only and no need to fetch the stamp in a next day or in next few hours. 
			</p>

			<p>Experience and skills to produce our Pre-inked stamps are not required as the processing procedures are so simple and the training would take less than 20 minutes to manufacture the Pre-inked stamps. Furthermore, our products provide you an accurate control of the stamp making consumable materials and assure to you that all rubbers made would be 100% accounted for and invoiced. But the consumable materials for making the Self-inking stamp are hardly accounted for and unable to control rubbers that made were 100% invoiced. You are unable to prove and verify the wastes of materials are really wasted rather than misappropriate used or not properly invoiced.    
			</p>

			<p>It is a new products with low pricing in your market place and there are huge rooms for development in your area. You are welcome to be our dealer or sub-agent in your region. 
			</p>

			<p>Thank you for your time and consideration on this matter. Please feel free to contact the undersigned for further information.
